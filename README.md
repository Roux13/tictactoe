# TicTacToe game
The console Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java.
In this project, I applied the principles of OOD. I made the application architecture modular, using interfaces to the maximum, following the principles of SOLID, and also applied the MVC pattern. This allowed me to apply most of the code when migrating the app to the Android platform. The project for Android is [here](https://github.com/Roux13/TicTacToeAndroid).

## Rules:
* The game uses standard rules TicTacToe and you can change size of field.
* You can selext the role for both players human or CPU (This uses simple random CPU, but there is possibility to add another logic CPU).  

Select size of field and player's roles:
